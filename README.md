## Description

This Puppet module manages some facets of tuned and ktune.


### This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they may be submitted to our [bug tracker](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it can be used independently:

 * When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be managed from the Puppet server.


## Setup


### What tuned affects

This module manages the following resouces:
  * /etc/tuned.conf
  * /etc/sysconfig/ktune
  * /etc/sysctl.ktune
  * tuned package
  * tuned service


### Beginning with tuned

Just include the `tuned` class on the systems you want to manage.

## Usage

Include the class from hiera:

```yaml
---
classes:
  - tuned
```

File contents can be tweaked by adding more hieradata:

``` yaml
---
tuned::disktuning_alpm: false
tuned::io_scheduler: cfq
```


## Reference

Please refer to the inline documentation within each source file, or to the module's generated YARD documentation for reference material.


## Limitations

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the [`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json) for the most up-to-date list of supported operating systems, Puppet versions, and module dependencies.


## Development

Please read our [Contribution Guide] (http://simp-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).

### Acceptance tests

This module includes [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) acceptance tests using the SIMP [Beaker Helpers](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers).  By default the tests use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a back-end; Vagrant and VirtualBox must both be installed to run these tests without modification. To execute the tests run the following:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake beaker:suites
```

Please refer to the [SIMP Beaker Helpers documentation](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
